## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- PostgreSQL only for Phase 1 (no CMS). Sanity CMS deferred to Phase 2+.
- Companies table is a first-class entity (not inline on user profiles).
- Clerk for auth with publicMetadata RBAC (not Organizations).
- Admin enters inventory manually in Phase 1 (no manufacturer self-serve upload).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Multi-SKU offer granularity: Can a manufacturer accept some SKUs and decline others within a single offer, or is it all-or-nothing? Must be decided before Phase 5.
- Offer expiration mechanism: Implementation approach (pg_cron, node-cron, or Railway cron) not yet decided. Needed for Phase 5.
